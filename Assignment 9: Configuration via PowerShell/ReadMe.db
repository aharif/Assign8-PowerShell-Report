- A PowerShell script that verifies the 'System' environment variable, 'LM_LICENSE_FILE', exists.
- If it exists, the script also verifies that the variable includes "27000@test.university.com" as one of the values in the variable.
- Values (if any are present) are separated by commas "," in this variable.
- Finally, if the value does not exist, this script also performs remediation 
- (add the desired value to the variable, without overwriting the existing values).
